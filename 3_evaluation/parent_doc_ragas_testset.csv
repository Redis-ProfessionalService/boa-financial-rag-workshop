Source: Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26","['Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signiﬁcant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the eﬀects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest Rate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all\n\nDecline in fair value\n\nTerm debt\n\ntenors 100 basis points, all\n\nIncrease in annual interest\n\n$\n\n3,089 $\n\ntenors\n\nexpense\n\n$\n\n194 $\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively aﬀect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% conﬁdence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally oﬀset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\n\n2022\n\n4,022\n\n201\n\nItem 8.

Answer: The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.
Source: Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6","['The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely aﬀected, and could in the future materially adversely aﬀect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and oﬀering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insuﬃcient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete eﬀectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company’s products and services are oﬀered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make signiﬁcant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company currently holds a signiﬁcant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Eﬀective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely aﬀected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signiﬁcant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no proﬁt or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces signiﬁcant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to oﬀer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently oﬀer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their oﬀerings or work collaboratively to oﬀer integrated solutions.']",1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.16666666666666666

As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may ﬂuctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any signiﬁcant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future ﬂuctuations in their value could result in signiﬁcant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or ﬁnancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signiﬁcant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble ﬁnal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will eﬀectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to signiﬁcant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s eﬀective tax rates are aﬀected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with diﬀering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require signiﬁcant judgment and be subject to diﬀering interpretations.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s eﬀective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition could be materially adversely aﬀected.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.']",0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655

Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be aﬀected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\n\nCompensation and Beneﬁts\n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company oﬀers a wide variety of beneﬁts for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\n\nInclusion and Diversity\n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves.

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those oﬀered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service oﬀerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and ﬁx all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it oﬀers.

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write- downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insuﬃcient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize ﬁrm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notiﬁed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the eﬀects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest Rate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all\n\nDecline in fair value\n\nTerm debt\n\ntenors 100 basis points, all\n\nIncrease in annual interest\n\n$\n\n3,089 $\n\ntenors\n\nexpense\n\n$\n\n194 $\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively aﬀect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% conﬁdence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally oﬀset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\n\n2022\n\n4,022\n\n201\n\nItem 8.

In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notiﬁed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.']",1.0,0.9999999999999996,0.034482758620689655

Answer: The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. It believes that if it is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success.

This includes the right to sell, or oﬀer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate speciﬁc content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may oﬀer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it diﬃcult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to oﬀer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\n\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and eﬀorts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\n\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and eﬀorts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Oﬃcer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics eﬀectively, it could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational ﬂexibility.\n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a signiﬁcant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products oﬀer ﬁnancing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such oﬀers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staﬃng selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The ﬁnancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\n\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.']",1.0,0.9999999999999997,0.07142857142857142

Answer: Information technology system failures or network disruptions, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, and malicious attacks seeking to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information.
Source: 10-K Filing (Form 10-K), [Company Name], filed on [Date].","['The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineﬀective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be suﬃcient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to signiﬁcant reputational, ﬁnancial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store conﬁdential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes signiﬁcant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information occur and could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share conﬁdential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure conﬁdential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always eﬀective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, conﬁdential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the conﬁdentiality, integrity or availability of conﬁdential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, ﬁnes or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conﬂict.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to conﬁdential information, including personal information, aﬀect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high proﬁle and the value of the conﬁdential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.']",1.0,1.0000000000000004,0.16666666666666666
