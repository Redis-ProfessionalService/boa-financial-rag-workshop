Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt.

Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services.

Answer: The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Item 1A. Risk Factors: Legal and Other Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.

As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may ﬂuctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any signiﬁcant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future ﬂuctuations in their value could result in signiﬁcant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or ﬁnancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signiﬁcant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble ﬁnal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will eﬀectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.'

Such endeavors may involve signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and signiﬁcant write-oﬀs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated beneﬁts of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any signiﬁcant investment could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse eﬀect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with ﬂuctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemniﬁcation provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemniﬁed third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.'
 'Engagement\n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\n\nHealth and Safety\n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identiﬁes potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting speciﬁc programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports ﬁled pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are ﬁled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information ﬁled by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-ﬁlings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about ﬁnancial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 4\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price can be aﬀected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely aﬀected.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors aﬀecting the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, past ﬁnancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.'
 'Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signiﬁcant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the eﬀects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest Rate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all\n\nDecline in fair value\n\nTerm debt\n\ntenors 100 basis points, all\n\nIncrease in annual interest\n\n$\n\n3,089 $\n\ntenors\n\nexpense\n\n$\n\n194 $\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively aﬀect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.']","If Apple fails to meet regulatory expectations or faces antitrust scrutiny, it could face potential risks such as increased regulation, government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\n\nCompensation and Beneﬁts\n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company oﬀers a wide variety of beneﬁts for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\n\nInclusion and Diversity\n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\n\nEngagement'
 'The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a signiﬁcant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could signiﬁcantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company’s ﬁnancial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely aﬀected and could in the future be materially adversely aﬀected by foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely aﬀects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to oﬀset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely aﬀect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneﬁcial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the beneﬁt. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely aﬀecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be eﬀective to oﬀset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse ﬁnancial eﬀects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and ﬂuctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.']","New product and service introductions can significantly impact Apple's net sales, cost of sales, and operating expenses.",1.0,1.0

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write- downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insuﬃcient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize ﬁrm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.'

Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

As of September 30, 2023, the Company had ﬁxed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform ﬁnal assembly and testing of ﬁnished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.

 'Other Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its ﬁnancial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that aﬀect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the signiﬁcant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves signiﬁcant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the ﬁnal outcome of these uncertainties will not be diﬀerent from that which is reﬂected in the Company’s reserves.

Such endeavors may involve signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and signiﬁcant write-oﬀs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated beneﬁts of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any signiﬁcant investment could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse eﬀect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with ﬂuctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemniﬁcation provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemniﬁed third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.'
 'The Company is exposed to credit risk and ﬂuctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively aﬀected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, ﬁnancial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate ﬂuctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may ﬂuctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any signiﬁcant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future ﬂuctuations in their value could result in signiﬁcant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or ﬁnancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signiﬁcant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble ﬁnal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.

 'The Company oﬀers complex hardware and software products and services that can be aﬀected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those oﬀered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service oﬀerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and ﬁx all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it oﬀers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues aﬀecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modiﬁcations, write-oﬀs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and signiﬁcant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory ﬁnes. Quality problems can also adversely aﬀect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.']","The potential consequences of Apple Inc. failing to obtain licenses for third-party intellectual property or uses such intellectual property on unreasonable terms include being unable to sell certain products or services, which can have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.",0.9973657126978218,1.0

 'Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to oﬀer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or oﬀer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate speciﬁc content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and signiﬁcant commodity pricing ﬂuctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be aﬀected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\n\n2021\n\n7,906 (4,056)\n\n4,258 2,674 3,434 1,277 5,878 3,215 20,736\n\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the ﬁnancial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and ﬁles income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s eﬀective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses signiﬁcant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\n\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the beneﬁt of various tax positions can be complex, involves signiﬁcant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the beneﬁt of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\n\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel conﬁrmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel.

 'For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.

17,"What obstacles might affect the Company's DRM & security solution progress, potentially straining ties with tech partners?","Question: What obstacles might affect the Company's DRM & security solution progress, potentially straining ties with tech partners?

Answer: The Company may experience obstacles such as information technology system failures or network disruptions, malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities, which could hinder the development and implementation of its DRM & security solution. Additionally, the Company's reliance on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products, may lead to disruptions or failures that could impact the progress of its DRM & security solution.

Source: Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7-11","['The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineﬀective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be suﬃcient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to signiﬁcant reputational, ﬁnancial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store conﬁdential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes signiﬁcant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of conﬁdential information occur and could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share conﬁdential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure conﬁdential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always eﬀective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, conﬁdential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.'
 'The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a signiﬁcant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could signiﬁcantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company’s ﬁnancial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely aﬀected and could in the future be materially adversely aﬀected by foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely aﬀects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to oﬀset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely aﬀect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneﬁcial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the beneﬁt. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely aﬀecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be eﬀective to oﬀset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse ﬁnancial eﬀects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and ﬂuctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.'
 'The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a signiﬁcant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve signiﬁcant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse eﬀect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely aﬀect the Company’s ﬂexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out- of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely aﬀect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for ﬁnal assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or ﬁnished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to ﬁnal destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, labor, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conﬂict, economic, business, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.'
 'The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the conﬁdentiality, integrity or availability of conﬁdential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, ﬁnes or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conﬂict.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to conﬁdential information, including personal information, aﬀect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high proﬁle and the value of the conﬁdential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be suﬃcient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insuﬃcient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11']","The obstacles that could affect the Company's DRM & security solution progress are potential investigations and litigation against other companies in the technology industry. If resolved against those companies, this could strain ties with tech partners and negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, government investigations and legal proceedings are currently ongoing for some licensing arrangements that generate revenue for the Company.",1.0000000000000002,1.0
18,"How might Apple's performance be impacted if economic headwinds intensify, driving up competition & eroding consumer trust?","Question: How might Apple's performance be impacted if economic headwinds intensify, driving up competition & eroding consumer trust?
Answer: According to the 2023 Form 10-K filing, macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, Apple's results of operations and financial condition. This suggests that if economic headwinds intensify, driving up competition and eroding consumer trust, it could negatively affect Apple's performance.

The answer is that Apple's performance could be impacted in several ways if economic headwinds intensify and drive up competition and erode consumer trust: 1. Reduced demand for Apple products: If consumers become more cautious about spending due to economic uncertainty, they may delay or cancel purchases of high-end electronics like iPhones. 2. Increased competition: As the economy slows down, competitors might gain an advantage by offering lower prices, which could make it harder for Apple to maintain its market share. 3. Supply chain disruptions: Economic headwinds can lead to supply chain issues, such as supplier insolvency or reduced capacity, making it difficult for Apple to deliver products on time and at the right quality. 4. Eroded consumer trust: As consumers become more cautious about spending, they may lose trust in Apple's products and services, leading to a decline in sales and revenue.",0.9999999999999997,0.6666666666666666
