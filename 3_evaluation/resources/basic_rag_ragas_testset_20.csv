The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26']",1.0,0.9934266151332972,0.010869565217391304
2,What drives Apple Inc.'s competitive edge & how does it impact results & financials?,"Question: What drives Apple Inc.'s competitive edge & how does it impact results & financials?
Answer: Apple Inc.'s competitive edge is driven by its ability to introduce innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The company's focus on designing and developing nearly the entire solution for its products, including hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services, allows it to differentiate itself from competitors. Additionally, Apple's strong brand reputation, customer experience, and loyalty drive its competitive edge.

The impact of this competitive edge is reflected in Apple's financial results. The company reported strong revenue growth in the September quarter, with a 24% increase in services revenue and a nearly 500% year-over-year (YoY) growth in Apple Pay transactions. The iPhone SE had a downward impact on iPhone ASP, but the overall gross margin was slightly dilutive. The introduction of new products and services, such as Apple TV and Apple Watch, has also contributed to strong revenue growth.

Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.'
 'The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.']",1.0,0.9999999999999996,0.1

 'As of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be aﬀected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\nHuman Capital\n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members.

 ""Simona, this is Tim. In terms of do I think the smart phone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. We're very optimistic that this too shall pass, and that the market and particularly us will grow again. The reason that we're optimistic is we look at sort of the three places that iPhone sales come from, and from an upgrade point of view, as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing. As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we have set a record from switchers from other platforms. The largest we've ever seen in any six month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform, with incredible product that is at a new price point for us, with the latest technology.\n\nAnd so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and were very excited about what's in our pipeline. All of those things make me optimistic. Your other question was on M&A, and regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we to, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we are excited about. As I have said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we have bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit, and whether it's  a great technology and great people. We continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [5] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you.""]",0.0,1.0,0.009615384615384616

As a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms which I agree with. And, it's just interesting to me because Apple has such control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And, I think that's reflected in WWDC as you pointed out. Opening up APIs and so forth on messaging, and you made the case there for Apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. Just curious is that the way -- am I characterizing this roughly correctly in term of how you think about the business?

14,"What drives changes in Apple's effective tax rates, and how do factors like earnings mix, statutory tax rates, and tax laws influence these fluctuations?","Question: What drives changes in Apple's effective tax rates, and how do factors like earnings mix, statutory tax rates, and tax laws influence these fluctuations?

Answer: According to the 10-K filings data, changes in Apple's effective tax rates are driven by a combination of factors including:

* Earnings mix: The company has reported that changes in its earnings mix can impact its effective tax rate. For example, in 2021, Apple's provision for income taxes was $14.527 billion, which represented an effective tax rate of 13.3%. In contrast, the company's effective tax rate was 14.4% in 2020 and 15.9% in 2019.
* Statutory tax rates: The company has reported that changes in statutory tax rates can also impact its effective tax rate. For example, in 2021, Apple's provision for income taxes was impacted by the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Act"").
* Tax laws: The company has reported that changes in tax laws and regulations can also impact its effective tax rate. For example, in 2021, Apple's provision for income taxes was impacted by the effects of the Act.

In general, Apple's effective tax rate is influenced by a combination of these factors, as well as other factors such as the company's geographic earnings mix and the timing of its earnings recognition.","['The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.'

Answer: The company mentions that the March quarter faces a more difficult year-over-year comparison relative to the rest of the year. This is because iPhone sales are highly dependent on new product releases and seasonal trends, which can lead to fluctuations in revenue.

 ""Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.""]",0.25,0.9999999999999997,0.009523809523809525

Answer: The Company may experience obstacles that could affect its DRM (digital rights management) and security solution progress, potentially straining ties with tech partners. These obstacles include government investigations and legal proceedings related to the Company's commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry, changes to laws and regulations in the future, and failures or disruptions of information technology systems.
