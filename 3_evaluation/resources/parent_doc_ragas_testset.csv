Answer: Apple offers services such as iBooks and iTunes for movies. According to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Computer, Inc., the revenue generated by these stores is less than $1 million.

Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter.  While you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes, movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share.  \nSo, can you just give us your perspective on the market?  Your expectations around getting those services back up and also regaining share? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [31]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we have been operational, which is several months, the revenue was less than $1 million.  And so, it's not a revenue-related issue. \nFrom our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers.  So, we are working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there.  We'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSimona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [32]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd, in terms of just regaining share in the market more broadly? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [33]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI think we've always had a -- if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two.  \nWhat we have to do and what we are doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best Smartphone to our customers there.  And, if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Computer, Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [34]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you.

Can you remind us is this a business that ultimately impacts the services line in any measurable way?  Or, is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?  \nAnd, separately is that, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that augmented reality theme has had with this whole Pokemon phenomenon.

Answer: $1.0 billion

Source: Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26","['Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signiﬁcant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the eﬀects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest Rate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all\n\nDecline in fair value\n\nTerm debt\n\ntenors 100 basis points, all\n\nIncrease in annual interest\n\n$\n\n3,089 $\n\ntenors\n\nexpense\n\n$\n\n194 $\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively aﬀect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% conﬁdence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally oﬀset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\n\n2022\n\n4,022\n\n201\n\nItem 8.

Answer: Apple Inc.'s competitive edge is driven by its ability to ensure the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. This requires significant investments in R&D.

While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely aﬀected, and could in the future materially adversely aﬀect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and oﬀering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insuﬃcient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete eﬀectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company’s products and services are oﬀered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make signiﬁcant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company currently holds a signiﬁcant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Eﬀective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely aﬀected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signiﬁcant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no proﬁt or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces signiﬁcant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to oﬀer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently oﬀer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their oﬀerings or work collaboratively to oﬀer integrated solutions.']",1.0,0.9999999999999999,0.16666666666666666

Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.

The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity.

In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.

Answer: There is no mention of a 7% boost in iPhone sales. The document actually states that iPhone sales were ""consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter"".

Source: Apple's Q2 FY 2023 Earnings Conference Call Transcript (https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.as p)","[""Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. \nRevenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. \nWe saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. \nDespite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. \nWe sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. \nAs we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. \nSecond, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. \nAnd third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. \nNext, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. \nThe services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. \nThe reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon.""]",0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.03225806451612903

6,"What impact do new product and service introductions have on Apple's net sales, cost of sales, and operating expenses?","Question: What impact do new product and service introductions have on Apple's net sales, cost of sales, and operating expenses?
Answer: New product and service introductions generally have a positive impact on Apple's net sales, as they tend to drive revenue growth. For example, in 2019, the introduction of the iPhone 11 series contributed to a 7% year-over-year increase in net sales. (Source: Apple Inc.'s Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019)

The impact on cost of sales is more nuanced. While new products and services may require additional manufacturing and supply chain investments, which can increase cost of sales, they also often drive economies of scale that help reduce costs over time. For instance, in Apple's 2020 Form 10-K filing, the company noted that its ""iPhone business has become increasingly complex"" due to the introduction of new features and products, but it also stated that ""we have been able to leverage our scale and efficiency gains to offset some of these increased costs."" (Source: Apple Inc.'s Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020)

As for operating expenses, they tend to increase with new product and service introductions due to investments in research and development, marketing, and hiring. For example, in Apple's 2018 Form 10-K filing, the company noted that its ""research and development expenses increased by $1.5 billion, or 16%, year over year,"" primarily driven by investments in new products and services.

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signiﬁcant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively aﬀect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the eﬀects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate Sensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest Rate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all\n\nDecline in fair value\n\nTerm debt\n\ntenors 100 basis points, all\n\nIncrease in annual interest\n\n$\n\n3,089 $\n\ntenors\n\nexpense\n\n$\n\n194 $\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively aﬀect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also aﬀect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, oﬀset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% conﬁdence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally oﬀset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\n\n2022\n\n4,022\n\n201\n\nItem 8.

The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\n\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.

Next question, please? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [10]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [11]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat.  Thank you very much. \nRegarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially which is clearly at the high end historically.  So, what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model?  Is that affecting this?  You mentioned the 451 is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. \nYou've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low so it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment.  So, where is the strength coming from in the September quarter? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [12]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve, we aren't going to get into products or product transitions.  However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter from Japan to Brazil to India.  \nSome even stronger numbers than that in Russia.  So, there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw.  \nOur highest ever recorded, and the number of switchers through the nine months or the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had.  And so, when we look at that and then we look at the things going on in our other products and services, and we think services will continue to grow very briskly.  We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [13]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay, fair enough.  As a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy.  You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms which I agree with.  And, it's just interesting to me because Apple has such control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms.  \nAnd, I think that's reflected in WWDC as you pointed out.  Opening up APIs and so forth on messaging, and you made the case there for Apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. \nJust curious is that the way -- am I characterizing this roughly correctly in term of how you think about the business?  And, how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [14]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell, we think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem, and so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. \nWe now have over 2 million apps in the app store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there's so many out there.  So, that's what we're doing. The TV and the -- you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all of the different things that they do in their lives.  \nAnd so, that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting huge investment in the home.  Making -- really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. \nIt's the reason for Apple TV and what we are doing in the living room.

Answer: According to Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO, they don't anticipate that the new regulations will have any material impact on their tax situation. They already pay full US tax on all profits from sales made in the United States, so changes in tax laws or statutory tax rates are unlikely to significantly affect their effective tax rate.

Thanks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [43]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, Rod, these are new regulations, and we are in the processing of assessing them. Frankly from first read, we don't anticipate that they are going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. \nAs you know, we are the largest US taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full US tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States, so we don't expect them to have any impact on us on tax reform. I will let Tim continue to  provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire US economy, and we remain optimistic that we are going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure, and around providing more return of capital to our investors. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [44]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when and that's difficult to say. But I think most people do recognize that it is in the US's interest to do this. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [45]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great, thanks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [46]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------""]",1.0,0.0,0.017241379310344827
