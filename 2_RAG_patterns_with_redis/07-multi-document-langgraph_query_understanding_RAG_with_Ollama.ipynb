   "source": "As we saw in notebook 06, a React agentic approach to search and treating a Redis retriever as a tool, and moreover leaving the reasoning to an LLM could lead to some uncertainty. A react agentic approach might be a better approach for planning in an uncertain situation (maybe a robotic application where parameters of the problem are unknown) and not for a search application where the tasks and steps to take are very well-defined. Any search starts with a query by a user. The first task is to understand the query or user's question. The hardest part is to understand the intent of the user which might need some personalized and contextual understanding of the user - which we will not address here. Nevertheless, the first component of a search application is query understanding. The second component is constructing a refined query via query augmentation, translation of user's query into a combination of target query language and mapping the query into a vector space using an embedding model. After query translation and representation in a vector space, it is time to retrieve the relevant documents. Here we showcase the Redis hybrid search capabilities and its integration in langchain. After fetching the most relevant documents, usually reranking happens (and by reranking we don't necessarily mean Semantic reranking - one could apply business logic in this step; for example, Ad injection and/or reordering based on business and user's context such as location or session information). In this notebook we don't use a reranker but employ a very simple document relevancy checker using the same `llama3` LLM. However, in a more realistic scenario, one should use task-specific or fine-tuned LLMs for each of these steps or even use the existing models or pipelines (query classifier, Learning To Rank, etc.). In fact, it might be a requirement that some models need to run faster/cheaper or be more explainable or certified for complaince reasons (such as Logistic Regression, decision trees, MaxEnt etc.) Please plug in any of such models instead of our generic LLM-based component if needed.

For Mac business overall, faced some processor constraints, leading to 5% revenue decline vs. last year. 1. Believes that Mac revenue would have been up vs. last year without those constraints. 2. Does not believe this challenge will have significant impact on 3Q results. 2. iPad: 1. Returned to growth in Greater China. 1. Generated strong double-digit growth in each of Co.'s other geographic segments. 2. Great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. 3. Late in qtr., launched all-new iPad Air with ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support and high-end performance powered by A12 Bionic chip. 4. Introduced new iPad Mini, major upgrade for iPad fans who love ultra-portable design. 1. Like new iPad Air, it delivers power of A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil. 3. AirPods: 1.

First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad. Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple. This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart.\\n\\nI'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018.

Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year.

I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.\", metadata={'id': 'chunk:2018-Nov-01-AAPL.txt-4fb9f18c-877a-4ba0-99c6-7bb6721d3872', 'chunk_id': '2018-Nov-01-AAPL.txt-4fb9f18c-877a-4ba0-99c6-7bb6721d3872', 'source_doc': '2018-Nov-01-AAPL.txt', 'doc_type': 'earning_call', 'ticker': 'AAPL', 'company_name': 'APPLE INC', 'sector': 'Information Technology', 'asset_class': 'Equity', 'location': 'United States', 'exchange': 'NASDAQ', 'currency': 'USD', 'market_value': '559365151.11', 'weight': '5.16', 'notional_value': '559365151.11', 'shares': '4305127', 'price': '129.93'}),\n",

    "The problem of search is still an old problem, and it is about representation of your information and storing it and getting back what you search for via a retrieval method. In the new `RAG` paradigm, information representation is the vector representation. So the more you can capture the nuances of your data using better and better embedding models, the better the `Retrieval`. However, as demonstrated above, we still need to take advantage of our metadata to increase the accuracy and `Augment` the query and also augment the context that we present to the `Generation` component. And most recently, LLMs do a good job of generating proper answers in the target natural languages. The quality of LLMs and their awareness of the domain language increase the quality of generated response.   "
